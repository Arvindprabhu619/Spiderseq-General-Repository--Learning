Good question.
We can download FASTQ directly. It’s not wrong. But there are clear pros/cons. Let’s break it down in a practical microbiome pipeline context:

Why People Often Download .sra First
Most FASTQ downloads come from ENA or NCBI’s EBI mirror, and they are usually:
Not quality-normalized
Sometimes missing quality scores (older runs)
Sometimes compressed differently
Occasionally truncated if the dataset was updated later

When you store the .sra, you store the original archival format exactly as submitted.
Then you convert to FASTQ locally.

Why you see only one .sra file

An .sra file is not fastq.
It is a binary container that can hold:

Forward reads
Reverse reads
Quality scores
Metadata

So even for paired-end data, you will get one .sra file per sample.
This does not mean it is single-end. It just means everything is packed inside.
