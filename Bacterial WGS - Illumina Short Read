Get docker installed in ubuntu, refer docker readme

Then

Step 3 — Create & build the unified WGS Docker image (detailed)
Goal: produce a reproducible Docker image wgs_bacteria:1.0 that contains all tools for the WGS pipeline (download, QC, trim, assembly, typing, AMR, phylogeny).

Work from your project root — the same $PROJECT you created earlier (e.g. ~/wgs_bacteria_project).

3.1 — Create the files

Open a terminal and run these commands (they create files with the exact contents we discussed):

spiseq@ASUS-TUF-Gaming-F15-FX506HF-FX506HF:~/Desktop$ cd ~/wgs_bacteria_project
pwd
ls
/home/spiseq/wgs_bacteria_project
spiseq@ASUS-TUF-Gaming-F15-FX506HF-FX506HF:~/wgs_bacteria_project$ 

spiseq@ASUS-TUF-Gaming-F15-FX506HF-FX506HF:~/wgs_bacteria_project$ # create Dockerfile
cat > Dockerfile <<'EOF'
# Dockerfile — unified bacterial WGS image
FROM continuumio/miniconda3:latest

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-o", "pipefail", "-c"]

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
      build-essential ca-certificates curl wget git unzip bzip2 \
      libbz2-dev liblzma-dev libzstd1 pigz procps && \
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY environment.yml /tmp/environment.yml

RUN conda install -y -n base -c conda-forge mamba && \
    mamba env create -n wgs -f /tmp/environment.yml && \
    conda clean -afy && \
    rm -f /tmp/environment.yml

SHELL ["conda", "run", "-n", "wgs", "/bin/bash", "-lc"]
ENV PATH=/opt/conda/envs/wgs/bin:$PATH
WORKDIR /work
ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/bash" ]
EOF

Step 3.2 — Build the Docker image

Run this command from inside ~/wgs_bacteria_project:

docker build -t wgs_bacteria:1.0 .

What this does:

Starts from continuumio/miniconda3:latest.

Installs system packages (apt-get).

Copies environment.yml into the image.

Installs mamba and uses it to create the wgs Conda environment.

Cleans temporary files to reduce image size.

Sets the working directory to /work and exposes the wgs environment binaries on PATH.

What we are doing step by step

Create a list of all required packages and versions

That’s what the environment.yml file is.

It lists every bioinformatics tool you need for bacterial WGS (FastQC, fastp, SPAdes, Prokka, etc.) with specific versions.

Pinning versions ensures reproducibility: if you rebuild later, the same versions are installed.

Create a Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is a “recipe” for a container.

It starts from a clean base image (Miniconda) and tells Docker how to build the container.

Steps include installing system packages, copying environment.yml, installing mamba, and creating a conda environment inside the image.

Build the Docker image

When you run docker build -t wgs_bacteria:1.0 ., Docker executes the Dockerfile instructions step by step:

Install OS dependencies

Copy environment.yml

Install mamba and create the wgs environment with all tools inside the image

Clean up to reduce image size

At the end, you get a self-contained Docker image that has all WGS tools installed and ready to use.

Use the Docker image

You can now run the container with docker run and all tools will be available inside it.

Your host OS is unaffected — nothing is installed globally.

You can mount your project folder so data and results are accessible outside the container.
